# Notice
I downloaded the sources file from [newhere.tw](https://newhere.tw) and rebuild a simpler site with 3 webpages. (I cannot replicate the complete website through cloning [the repo](https://github.com/LaoShihChieh/LaoShihChieh.github.io/tree/master/newhere.tw) and made pull request because many files are missingðŸ˜¥) You could directly replace the `assets/style.css` file but the changes in the HTMLs should be imported manually to the PHP files. Below are the changes made to HTML files. View diff for more details.

## Links
For navigation in github page for demonstration, a few links have been updated:
- the logo in nav (linked to `index.html`)
- the first article (linked to `5.html`)
- campus category in nav (linked to `campus.html`)

All links are invalid except the links above. The changes of internal links and image paths should be ignored while importing.

## Class Added
- Added `article`, `category`, and `home` classes to body elements
- Added `article-card` class
- Added `author info` class in article page

## Structure changed
- Wrapped å»¶ä¼¸é–²è®€ and Follow us section with a `div` with `read-more` class (the grey area).

## Better Pratices
- Removed empty paragraphs in article page
- Removed some inline styles. (You should also advoid other inline styles and `!important` for best practices.)
- Updated Noto Serif TC src to support font weights:
    ```html
    <link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Serif+TC:wght@200;300;400;500;600;700;900&display=swap"
    rel="stylesheet">
    ```
- Code format (auto-formatting done by editor, could be ignore)
